Hi there, I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley (Class of '23) working towards a degree in Data Science (concentration: linguistics). I am from Highland Park, New Jersey. 
I'm from Highland Park, New Jersey--it's a small town right next to Rutgers University, our state school. I enjoy writing, learning new things, and exploring the intersection of technology and the humanities and social sciences.
